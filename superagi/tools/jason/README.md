SuperAGI AgentSpeak TOOL

Jason/AgentSpeak(L) with Py4J integration to talk to Python.

This code is forked from:

    https://github.com/aindilis/jason

This code still needs for its Jason<->SWI-Prolog be be decoupled.

It includes much code that is irrelevant to the LabLab.ai Autonomous
Agent Hackathon.

The only relevant files are:

    ./run-python.sh

and

    ./examples/python-adapter/

Our Jason/AgentSpeak(L) adapter code will be cleaned up, worked into a
SuperAGI Tool, and then moved to:

    ./superagi/tools/

In the interim, be sure to see Ghostter's and Demiurge's fixes and
additions to the github tool:

    SuperAGI/superagi/tools/github/
